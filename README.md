Update of swefans mod
https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=35547.0

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3498407243).
This version will not receive any further updates.

- Added the "Floor"-tag to all floors to make them count for the All floored-requirement of some royals
- Added the "Fine Floor"-tag to Plasteel Bars Mosaic, Sterile Lux, Royal Gold and Royal Silver, should now be fit for Royals.

All the floors have at least 1 in the beauty stats, but they need a lot of resources and a lot of work, so I think it's balanced. 
The novelty are the leather floors (at least I have never seen a mod with leather floors)
