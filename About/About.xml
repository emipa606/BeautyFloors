Update of swefans mod
https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=35547.0

- Added the "Floor"-tag to all floors to make them count for the All floored-requirement of some royals
- Added the "Fine Floor"-tag to Plasteel Bars Mosaic, Sterile Lux, Royal Gold and Royal Silver, should now be fit for Royals.
